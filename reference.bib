	abstract = {This paper examines the effects of social security on the steady-state growth of per capita income in an endogenous growth model in which agents care about their own consumption, the number of children, and the welfare of each child. It shows that an unfunded program may simulate growth by reducing fertility and increasing the ratio of human capital investment per child to per family income when bequests are positive. Also, it may cause faster growth than funded programs, especially when receipts from funded programs are independent of contributions. When voluntary saving is positive, funded social security is neutral if receipts are linked to contributions, and most likely depresses growth if receipts are independent of contributions.},

	abstract = {Grandparents at working age frequently take care of their grandchildren. These time transfers may constrain the formal labor supply of grandparents. Using an instrumental variable strategy and multiple waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we estimate the causal effect of grandparenthood on the labor supply of working-age grandparents in ten European countries. We find a large negative impact of grandparenthood on the employment rate of women aged 55 to 64. The effect is particularly pronounced in countries where the availability of formal childcare is low. A complier characterization reveals that the large LATE applies to a small but not selected group of potential grandmothers and may explain a substantial share of the gender gap in employment at later working age. Male labor supply does not significantly adjust in response to grandparenthood. We further find that grandmothers are more likely to transfer gifts to their children than women who are not grandmothers, whereby grandmothers substitute between time and gift transfers.},

	abstract = {From 1995 to 2015 the aggregate US college completion rate increased almost 50 percent, but completion trends differed markedly by family background. We consider whether changing college preparedness contributed to growth in aggregate completion and differences by family background. We first document parallel empirical trends in precollege investments, college preparedness, and completion. We use these moments to discipline a quantitative model of intergenerational human capital investment with heterogeneous families. Within the model, investment trends generate half of the empirical increase in college completion. The model implies that subsidizing precollege investments increases college completion and lifetime earnings more than college tuition subsidies. (JEL I23, I26, J12, J24, J31)},
